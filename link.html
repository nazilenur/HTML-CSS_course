    <h2 id="f1">Arenophryne rotunda</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> 
        A medium-sized species of frog reaching up to 4 cm in body length. It has a white or grey back, with mostly black but some red patches and spots. There is often a thin, cream-coloured longitudinal stripe along the middle of the back. The belly is white, with a large dark patch in the middle. The pupil is horizontal and the iris is gold. Fingers and toes are unwebbed, both without discs. The fingers are very wide and short, and are used for digging head first into sand. This is very rare among Australian burrowing frogs as most burrow backwards so that their legs go under the surface first.
        
        <b>Breeding Biology</b>
        Eggs are laid on land as a single, small clutch underground in wet sandy burrows. There is no true tadpole stage; all development takes place inside the egg before little frogs emerge, a process that lasts around two months. Breeds during autumn before winter rains and during winter to spring.
        
        <b>Similar Species</b>
        Looks very similar to Arenophryne xiphorhyncha, but has a slightly different distribution and a lighter coloured back.

   <h2 id="f2">Heleioporus eyrei</h2>    
   <p>
    <b>Description</b>
    A large species of frog reaching up to 6.5 cm in body length. It has a brown or grey back with white, grey, orange or yellow patches. There is often a pale vertical stripe on the tip of the snout. The belly is white. The pupil is vertical and the iris is silver-grey. Fingers are unwebbed and toes slightly webbed, both without discs. Adult males lack the large black spines on their fingers that are present in other Heleioporus species.
    
    <b>Breeding Biology</b>
    Eggs are laid as a foamy mass out of the water inside burrows near swamps and other temporary or permanent water bodies. Tadpoles can reach a total length of up to 7.5 cm and are brown or gold in colour, with very distinct cream-coloured or gold lateral lines along the sides of the body. They often remain on the bottom of water bodies and escape into water after their burrows are flooded, taking four to six months to develop into frogs. Breeds during autumn.
    
    <b>Similar Species</b>
    Looks similar to Heleioporus albopunctatus, Heleioporus barycragus, Heleioporus inornatus, and Heleioporus psammophilus in its distribution, but lacks the yellow stripe from the eye to the arm present in Heleioporus barycragus, and distinct white or cream spots on the back as present in Heleioporus albopunctatus. It can most easily be distinguished from Heleioporus inornatus and Heleioporus psammophilus by its call.

   <h2 id="f3">Litoria microbelos</h2>
   <p>
    <b>Description</b>
    A small species of frog reaching up to 2 cm in body length. It has a brown back, with a wide, lighter brown longitudinal stripe along the middle. There is often indistinct dark brown mottling on the head. There is a dark brown stripe from the tip of the snout to the side and a white stripe underneath the eye. The belly is white. The pupil is horizontal and the iris is gold. Fingers are unwebbed and toes are one-third webbed, both without discs.

    <b>Breeding Biology</b>
    Eggs are laid as small clusters attached to vegetation under the surface of the water in swamps, lagoons, billabongs, and ditches. Tadpoles can reach a total length of nearly 2.5 cm and are brown and gold in colour, with a dark longitudinal stripe from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail. They often remain at the bottom and shallow edges of water bodies, and it is unknown how long they take to develop into frogs. Breeds during spring to summer in the wet season.

    <b>Similar Species</b>
    Looks similar to Litoria bicolor, Litoria fallax, and Litoria longirostris in its distribution, but has a different back colour to Litoria bicolor and Litoria fallax, and lacks the long and very pointed snout of Litoria longirostris.

   </p>

   <h2 id="f4">Litoria splendida</h2>
   <p>
    <b>Description</b>
    A large species of frog reaching up to 12 cm in body length. It has a bright green back, with white or yellow spots. The belly is white. The pupil is horizontal and the iris is gold. The armpits, groin and backs of the thighs are bright yellow or orange. Fingers are unwebbed and toes are nearly fully webbed, both with very large discs. There are big glands on the head and above the shoulders.

    <b>Breeding Biology</b>
    Eggs are laid as small floating clusters that sometimes sink to the bottom of rock pools. Tadpoles can reach a total length of up to 6.5 cm and are grey-brown in colour, with some white spots. They swim throughout all depths of water bodies, and may take around three to four months to develop into frogs. Breeds during summer in the wet season.

     <b>Similar Species</b>
    Looks similar to Litoria caerulea and Litoria cavernicola in its distribution, but has big glands on the head and above the shoulders.

   <h2 id="f5">Pseudophryne raveni</h2>
   <p>
    <b>Description</b>
    A small species of frog reaching up to nearly 3 cm in body length. It has a copper-coloured or reddish-grey back, with small black spots or patches. There is a black stripe from the tip of the snout to the groin, below which the side and head are often grey with white and black dots, clearly separated from the back colour. The belly has black and white marbling. The pupil is horizontal, and the iris is gold in the upper half and dark brown in the lower half. The upper surfaces of the arms and legs are red; the undersurfaces are grey or black. Fingers and toes are unwebbed, both without discs.
    
    <b>Breeding Biology</b>
    Eggs are laid as one small cluster on land in seepages under moist leaf litter, rocks, logs, and sedges. The nest is guarded by the male, as it is with other Pseudophryne species. Tadpoles can reach a total length of up to 2.5 cm, and are dark brown or light brown-gold in colour. They are released into water bodies after the nest is flooded by rain. It is unknown how long they take to develop into frogs once released. Breeds during spring to autumn after rain.
    
    <b>Similar Species</b>
    Looks similar to Pseudophryne bibronii, Pseudophryne coriacea, and Pseudophryne major in its distribution, but Pseudophryne bibronii and Pseudophryne major both lack clearly separated side and back colours, while Pseudophryne coriacea is generally brighter in colour.

    <h2 id="f6">Rheobatrachus silus</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Description:</b> 
        A medium-sized species of frog reaching up to nearly 6 cm in body length. It had a brown, grey or black back, with dark patches. There was also a dark stripe from behind the eye to the shoulder. The belly was white, and the male had brown flecks on the throat. The pupil was vertical, and the iris was gold with distinct, thin black veins throughout. Fingers were unwebbed and claw-shaped; toes were fully webbed with small discs. It was one of only three Australian species known to be almost entirely aquatic; its large eyes, very short snout, and fully webbed toes were all adaptations for living under the water.
        
        <b>Breeding Biology:</b>
        An amazing process whereby fertilised eggs were swallowed by the female. Tadpoles reached a total length of up to nearly 3 cm and developed inside the stomach, where they took around 6 weeks to develop into frogs. The little frogs were then ejected from the mouth of the female. Breeding was recorded during spring.
        
        <b>Similar Species:</b>
        Did not look similar to any other species in its former distribution.

        <b>Distribution:</b>
        Formerly found in the Conondale and Blackall Ranges of southeast QLD, but has likely become extinct due to the amphibian chytrid fungus. It has not been seen since 1981.

    <h2 id="f7">Uperoleia rugosa</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Description</b>
        A small species of frog reaching up to 3 cm in body length. It has a brown or grey back, with dark brown patches on the lower back and shoulders. There is sometimes a V-shaped marking between the eyes. The belly is clear grey in the middle and pale pink near the under-surface of the arms and legs, covered with tiny white specks. The male has a dark grey, nearly black throat. The under-surfaces of the arms and thighs are pale pink. The pupil is diamond-shaped, and the iris is gold. The groin and the fronts and backs of the thighs are bright red. Fingers and toes are unwebbed, both without discs. The parotoid glands on the shoulders often look like two brown or sand-coloured patches.
        
        <b>Breeding Biology</b>
        Eggs are laid singly on vegetation under the surface of the water in ponds, and in temporarily flooded ditches in grassland and near roads. Tadpoles can reach a total length of up to 3.5 cm, and are dark brown in colour. They often remain on the bottom of water bodies, and take around two months to develop into frogs. Breeds during spring to autumn.
        
        <b>Similar Species</b>
        Looks very similar to Uperoleia fusca and Uperoleia laevigata in its distribution, but has a different belly colour to Uperoleia fusca and is smaller than, and has a different call to, Uperoleia laevigata.</p>
